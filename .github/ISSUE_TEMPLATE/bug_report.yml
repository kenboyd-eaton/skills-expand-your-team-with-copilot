        ## For the Coding Agent ü§ñ
        
        **Implementation Hints:**
        - Check error handling in the registration endpoints
        - Verify database constraints and validation
        - Look for frontend error display mechanisms
        - Test with different browsers if needed
        - Consider rate limiting or duplicate registration checks
