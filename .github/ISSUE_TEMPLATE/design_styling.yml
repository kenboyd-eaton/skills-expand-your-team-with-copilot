        **Implementation Guidelines:**
        - Update CSS variables in `src/static/styles.css` for color changes
        - Ensure accessibility standards are maintained (contrast ratios, etc.)
        - Test design on different screen sizes and devices
        - Use only standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
        - Keep design consistent with existing UI patterns
        - Consider performance impact of any new graphics or animations
        - Update any hardcoded colors throughout the application
        - Test that all interactive elements remain functional after design changes
