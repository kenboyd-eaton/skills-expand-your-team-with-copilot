# Teacher Guide: Requesting Changes

## How to Request Changes to the Website

Don't worry about writing code or technical details! Our issue templates will help you provide all the information needed for our coding agent to make your requested changes.

### Step 1: Create a New Issue

1. Go to the **Issues** tab on GitHub
2. Click **New Issue**
3. Choose the template that best matches your request

### Step 2: Choose the Right Template

We have 5 different templates for different types of requests:

#### üêõ Bug Report
**Use when:** Something is broken or not working correctly
- Example: Students can't register for activities
- Example: Error messages appear when they shouldn't
- Example: The website doesn't work on mobile phones

#### ‚ú® Feature Request  
**Use when:** You want to add something new to the website
- Example: Add a dark mode toggle
- Example: Add a calendar view of activities
- Example: Add filtering by difficulty level

#### üé≠ Activity Management
**Use when:** You need to add, change, or remove activities
- Example: Add a new Robotics Club
- Example: Change Chess Club meeting times
- Example: Update the description for Drama Club

#### üé® Design & Styling
**Use when:** You want to change how the website looks
- Example: Change colors to match school branding
- Example: Add the school mascot to the page
- Example: Make buttons bigger and easier to click

#### üîß General Enhancement
**Use when:** Your request doesn't fit the other categories
- Example: Update outdated documentation
- Example: Improve website performance
- Example: Fix inconsistent information

### Step 3: Fill Out the Form

Each template has a form with specific questions. Fill out as much as you can:

- **Be specific** - Instead of "make it better," say "add a button to switch to dark mode"
- **Explain why** - Help us understand the problem you're trying to solve
- **Give examples** - If you've seen similar features elsewhere, mention them
- **Think about success** - How will you know when the change is done correctly?

### Step 4: Submit and Wait

After you submit the issue:
1. Our coding agent will review your request
2. The agent may ask clarifying questions
3. The agent will implement your changes
4. You'll be notified when it's ready to test

## Tips for Better Requests

### ‚úÖ Good Examples:
- "Students keep asking for dark mode because it's easier on their eyes during evening study"
- "Change the blue colors to our school colors: white background with lime green accents"
- "Add a new activity: Robotics Club, meets Tuesdays 3:30-5:00 PM, max 15 students"

### ‚ùå Less Helpful Examples:
- "Make it look better"
- "Fix the website"
- "Add more stuff"

### Questions? 
If you're not sure which template to use or need help, you can:
- Start a discussion in the **Discussions** tab
- Ask a colleague who has used the system before
- Choose the template that seems closest and explain your situation

Remember: You don't need to know how to code! Just describe what you want in plain English, and our coding agent will handle the technical details.
